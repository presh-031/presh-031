* I am a self-motivated frontend developer with a strong work ethic.
* I possess a comprehensive understanding of core frontend technologies and frameworks essential for building and maintaining websites.
* I am also continuously expanding my knowledge of relevant backend technologies.
* I excel at problem-solving, thrive in collaborative work environments, and prioritize client or employer satisfaction in all my endeavors.

* ⚡  I'm secretly motivated by the fact that the Internet is held together by duct tape and chewing gum.
* ⚡️ Fun fact about me : I watch a tech review video with every meal. Usually either mrwhosetheboss or mkbhd.
